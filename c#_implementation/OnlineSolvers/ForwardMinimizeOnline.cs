        // ADDED THE OPTION TO PUT ONLY 1 JAB IN A NEW HOSPITAL (before, he had to put both in).
        //   This is finnicky, as he does not care to e.g. put both jabs in H0, or both in H1.
        //   the only reason he puts them in 0, is because he checks hospitals in order {0,1,2,3..}
        //   and only picks a new best option based on >, not on >=. So.. bit finnicky, but should work.

        // after extensive testing of a specific case (back when he didn't add new hospital),
        //  it gave flawless answers until now.

        // This will definitely give run-time errors on large cases. It is already kinda slow now.
